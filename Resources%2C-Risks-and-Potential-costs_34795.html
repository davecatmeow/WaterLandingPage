                    <p>identification of resources, risks, potential costs and who will bear them</p><h3 id="Resources,RisksandPotentialcosts-Resources">Resources</h3><p>According to the features of the project, there exist two kinds of knowledge requirements that could be seen as resources. The first category is coding skills, which is similar to other projects. The second part relates to the specific knowledge behind the PDE systems. Although the developing process could be done with a limited understanding of the PDEs, deeper knowledge would make the project easier.</p><p>For potential coding skill learning, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.pluralsight.com/</a> would provide useful courses and tutorials. TechLauncher might provide licenses for Pluralsight, otherwise, we could utilize other free-access sources. For physics and mathematics background, since our clients are researchers from data61, CSIRO, itâ€™s reasonable to gain academic or learning materials from clients. </p><p>There are also computing resources needed, which will be discussed in potential cost.</p><h3 id="Resources,RisksandPotentialcosts-Risks">Risks</h3><p>The direct risk that might be caused is the delay of related academic progress. Especially, our results are likely to be presented as a tool in some part of a conference paper. Details about this could be found in the milestone or timeline.</p><p>Also, the goal of this semester is to finally generate a set of benchmarks for ML problems. If things go smoothly, future research will depend on our data. So it is our responsibility to make sure the results fit academic standards.</p><p>If we go deeper into the real issues involved in the projects we develop, our products may end up as an integral part of the reference tool for decision-making departments, such as fire spreading or groundwater problems. The emulator is an estimation of physical simulation, but incorrect data or unforeseen bugs may lead to mistakes in real-world decisions. This again emphasizes the importance of the reliability of our work.</p><h3 id="Resources,RisksandPotentialcosts-Potentialcosts">Potential costs</h3><p>The data generation with physical simulation requires plenty of computational power. It is impossible to generate 100GB of data on personal devices. Thus, computing clusters or super-computer would be necessary after the prototype verification. The CPU-time resources on high-performance computing are quite costly if clients or ANU could not assign the resources.</p><p>Also, for stage 2 the project might require training ML model on GPU. </p>
